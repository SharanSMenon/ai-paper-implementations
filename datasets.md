# Datasets Used

This sheet talks about the datasets used for evaluating these models. 

1. Animal 138 - A Dataset of 138 animal species each containing around 30-50 images of animal species
2. Animal 151 - An updated version of Animals 138 with 151 species instead of 138. Both Animals 138/151 represent challenging datasets due to the low number of images per class.
3. Birds 64 - A dataset of 64 bird species, with about 150 images per class. This is a subset of [Birds 350](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) on Kaggle and it is private.
4. CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 - Everybody already knows what this is. :)
